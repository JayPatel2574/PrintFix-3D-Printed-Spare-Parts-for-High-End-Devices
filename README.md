# PrintFix: 3D-Printed Spare Parts for High-End Devices

### Project Overview
PrintFix is an ongoing self-initiated project (Sep â€™24 - Ongoing) aimed at developing a business concept to provide 3D-printed spare parts for expensive, non-repairable market-standard devices. The project focuses on addressing a niche demand for cost-effective and sustainable solutions in the repair industry.

### Key Contributions

- **Business Concept Development**  
  Partnered in a two-person team to conceptualize a business offering 3D-printed spare parts for high-end devices, providing a cost-effective solution for customers seeking to repair otherwise non-repairable products.

- **Prototyping & Web Scraping**  
  Utilized web scraping techniques to extract, refine, and customize 3D models for specific parts. This demonstrated advanced skills in data acquisition, processing, and 3D design for precise component replication.

- **Real-World Application**  
  Successfully designed and 3D-printed a replacement joint for a damaged Sony headset. This real-world example showcased problem-solving skills and demonstrated the potential for scalable innovations in repair-focused industries.

### Results
This project highlights the potential for PrintFix to disrupt the spare parts market by offering an accessible, eco-friendly solution for high-end device repairs through 3D printing technology.
